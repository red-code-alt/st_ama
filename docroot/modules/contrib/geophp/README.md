Provides integration with the geoPHP library: [GeoPHP](https://geoPHP.net)

This module does not provide any direct functionality to end-users or site-administrators. Install it only if
another module requires it.

GeoPHP is a open-source native PHP library for doing geometry operations. It is written entirely in PHP and can
therefore run on shared hosts. It can read and write a wide variety of formats (WKT, WKB, GeoJSON, KML, GPX,GeoRSS).It works with all Simple-Feature geometries (Point, LineString, Polygon, GeometryCollection etc.) and can be used to
get centroids, bounding-boxes, area, and a wide variety of other useful information.
